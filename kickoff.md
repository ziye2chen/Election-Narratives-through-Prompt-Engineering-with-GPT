# Kickoff Questions
### a. What is the project focus/overall goal?
The project aims to develop a comprehensive database of campaign emails from all candidates with the necessary infrastructure to collect email contacts, running for election to US Senate seats in November. This initiative focuses on understanding the narratives, perspectives, talking points, potential misinformation, shared links, and conspiracy theories propagated through these campaign emails. Additionally, the project will involve conducting basic sentiment analysis to evaluate the tone of the campaigns in their email correspondences, whether positive or negative.
### b. Why is this project important?
**Enhancing Political Transparency:** By compiling and analyzing campaign emails, the project contributes to greater transparency in political campaigning, allowing stakeholders to see firsthand how candidates communicate with potential voters.  
**Identifying Misinformation:** It helps in identifying and addressing the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.  
**Voter Education:** The analysis can aid voters in making informed decisions by understanding the key issues and positions of various candidates, beyond surface-level campaign rhetoric.  
**Strategic Insights:** For political analysts, campaigners, and strategists, the findings can provide valuable insights into effective communication strategies and voter engagement tactics.  
### c. What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
The text and visual content of the campaign emails in [jengabuilding90@gmail.com](jengabuilding90@gmail.com), including the subject line and body text.
### d. What are potential limitations of the project?
**Volume and Variability of Data:** The sheer volume of emails sent out by different campaigns can be overwhelming, and the variability in content, format, and frequency of emails across campaigns may complicate analysis and comparison.  
**Bias in Email Collection:** There may be inherent biases in the collection of emails, such as overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain campaigns, which could skew the analysis and findings.  
**Analysis of Sentiments and Narratives:** Sentiment analysis and the identification of narratives within the text are complex tasks. Automated tools may not accurately capture the nuances of political language, sarcasm, or the context within which certain statements are made, leading to potential misinterpretations.   
**Technological and Resource Constraints:** The project requires sophisticated text analysis tools and significant computational resources, especially for processing large volumes of text and conducting detailed sentiment analysis. Limitations in technology or resources could affect the depth and quality of analysis.
### e. What are your next steps? Divide tasks amongst the team.
We plan to integrate an LLM into our project.
So in the next step, we'll focus on defining specific objectives like email conclusion, narrative, and sentiment analysis. Then prepare and preprocess our data, select and customize an appropriate LLM model.
