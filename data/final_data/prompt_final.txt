What I am giving you are some emails from a continuous period of a week, you need to read each email and summarize the main content by different political parties in this period in detail. Each content after "body": " represents an email. You need to summarize all the content of the same political party, and then output a paragraph for each political party, rather than each email. It should be noted that some emails do not explicitly mention political parties, you need to categorize them based on their relevance and ignore emails that are not related to politics. But you also need to summarize the content that does not involve political parties but is related to politics (neutral). Finally, you need to provide your detailed evaluate. 

I will give you some files, please analyze what themes or narratives is each political party pushing? Does this change by state?
